# Blockhain based e-voting system 
E-VOTING IS AMONG the key public sectors that can be disrupted by blockchain technology.BEV issues each voter a
“wallet” containing a user credential. Each voter gets a single “coin” representing one opportunity to vote. Casting a
 vote transfers the voter’s coin to a candidate’s wallet. A voter can spend his or her coin only once. However, voters 
can change their vote before a preset deadline.we argue that blockchains might address two of the most prevalent concerns 
in voting today:  <br />
(i) voter access and  <br />
(ii) voter fraud. <br />
The idea is as follows. Eligible voters cast a ballot anonymously using a computer or smartphone. BEV employs an encrypted key 
and tamperproof personal IDs. For example, the mobile e-voting platform of the Boston-based startup Voatz employs smart 
biometrics and real-time ID verification. The public ledger ties each cast ballot to an individual voter and establishes 
a permanent, immutable record. No bad actor can engage in nefarious activities because such activities will be evident 
on the ledger or corrected by a peer-to-peer consensus network.To compromise the network, hackers would need to 
successfully hack most of the blocks (files with transaction records) before new blocks were introduced.The 
blockchain’s audit trail ensures that no vote has been changed or removed and that no fraudulent and illegitimate votes
have been added. Put simply, blockchains enable the creation of tamper-proof audit trails for voting.
To address voter tampering, blockchains generate cryptographically secure voting records. Votes are recorded accurately,
permanently, securely, and transparently.So, no one can modify or manipulate votes.Furthermore, blockchains preserve 
participants’ anonymity while still being open to public inspection.BEV might promote more voter participation.BEV is a 
flexible solution that facilitates voting from distance.Also, improved identity verification can help increase access and
participation.BEV can increase the speed with which votes are tallied.BEV can eliminate ambiguities.BEV can promote greater
transparency and clarity to voters.Blockchains’ decentralized nature makes attacks more difficult.
